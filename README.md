# The-Case-of-Nifty
This project embarks on the analysis of stock market data, focusing on Nifty monthly and yearly returns over 
a 20-year period.The main goal is to uncover recurring patterns, with particular attention given to the year 
2020, a significant timeframe characterized by the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing Python libraries like 
Seaborn, Pandas, yfinance, and Matplotlib, the project involves importing the dataset, constructing heat 
maps to visualize monthly returns, and generating histograms to illustrate the spread of returns across 
various standard deviation buckets. Additionally, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is carried out to extract 
insightful observations and draw meaningful conclusions. Furthermore, the project expands to include the 
development of a web application using the Flask micro web framework, offering users an interactive 
platform. Ultimately, this endeavor seeks to deepen comprehension of stock market dynamics and empower 
investors to make informed decisions
